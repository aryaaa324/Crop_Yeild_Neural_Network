# Crop_Yeild_Neural_Network
This project uses a deep learning model to predict agricultural yield based on various factors such as soil quality, seed variety, fertilizer amount, sunny days, rainfall, and irrigation schedule. The project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting agricultural yield and aid in decision-making for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.
